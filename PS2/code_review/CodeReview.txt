[190 Entry.java]: toString() method can follow lazy initialization and store the string since the class is immutable and the contact will not change
[Entry.java]: No method to check if all fields are empty
[175 Entry.java]: getBuilder() defined but never used. Implement a clone or modifier method
[Entry.java]: No input validations for phone number and email address
[Entry.java]: In each field instead of  using if (<field> == null) {<field> = "";}, Use  if (<field> == null) return "" to save operation "".trim()
[Entry.java]: equals() not implemented hence the contains() method will not work in the AddressBook. hashCode() needs to be implemented to support equals()
[48 AddressBook.java]: This will not work for two different Entry objects with the same details.
[65 AddressBook.java]: Can directly use the Class string generated by toString() and reduce multiple fetches
[AddressBook.java]: Instead of using <field>ContainAll() we can define a single parameterized function fieldContains(String field, String str)
[201 AddressBook.java]: remove method will also not work for a new Entry with same details, only the same object can be used to remove an Entry
